# Detect_Parallel_Epistasis

These scripts accompany Fisher, Kryazhimskiy & Lang (2018). 

These scripts are intended to analyze datasets of mutated genes in experimental evolution studies. Raw datasets should be formatted as tables wherein column names are clone/sample names and rows contain mutated gene names. Missing data must be supplied as NA values to make all genotype vectors equal length.
